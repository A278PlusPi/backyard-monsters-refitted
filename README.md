## Repo Information
We are running a lightweight [Koa](https://koajs.com/) server written in [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), with an [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/index.html) database leveraging [MikroORM](https://mikro-orm.io/), as our ORM of choice. The client is written in [ActionScript 3](https://help.adobe.com/en_US/FlashPlatform/reference/actionscript/3/index.html) and uses [Adobe FlashPlayer](https://www.adobe.com/products/flashplayer/end-of-life.html) to display its content. 

This repository contains the entire modified SWF (Shockwave Flash) client files, along with the corresponding server component rebuilt from the ground up for Kixeye's 2010 Flash client, Backyard Monsters. The client is running on version 128.5690.

<br>

## üöÄ How to Play
We recommend to run the game in the native Flash Player projector, which is included in the root of this repository [here](./flashplayer_32.exe). Once you have downloaded and opened the Flash Player, click on `File > Open` and select the game file. You can find the game file under our [latest releases](/monkey-patch/backyard-monsters-refitted/releases).

## Client Setup

1. Follow the instructions carefully on our [client setup & configuration](/monkey-patch/backyard-monsters-refitted/wiki/Client-Setup%2C-IntelliSense-%26-Configuration) Wiki page.

2. To contribute you will need to copy your changes to the src directory. If you are wondering why we are using this horrible workflow please see [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md) for more information. If you are able to figure out how to compile directly to swf without unlinking all assets, please let us know.
