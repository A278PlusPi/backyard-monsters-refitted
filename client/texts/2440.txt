Moloch has fled back to his lair, and now you can take the war to him. Use the Skull of Doom to enter the underground realm of Inferno and battle Moloch&apos;s network of bases. You can use any monsters you have in your arsenal, but catapults are too big to fit through the entrance. Can you drive that annoying demon out of his own territory?
